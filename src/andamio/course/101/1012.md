### **Lesson 101.2: How to Create a Nami Wallet?**

This step-by-step guide will cover how to create a Cardano Native Nami Wallet.

**1. Go to the official Nami Website**
The first step is to visit [namiwallet.io](https://www.namiwallet.io/) and select your preferred browser to download the extension. We will provide a step-by-step guide using the Brave Browser for this tutorial.

Clicking on the browser icon will automatically open a new tab in the Chrome web store, where you can add the extension to your browser.

**2. Add the Nami Wallet Extension**

Once the Chrome Web Store is open, click `Add to Brave`.

If you can't find the extension directly on the toolbar, you can find it by clicking on the puzzle icon as shown in the image below.

For faster access and a quick shortcut to the Nami Wallet, you can use the "pin icon" to pin the Nami Wallet extension. This way, it will be available on the Google Chrome toolbar.

**3. Create a Nami New Wallet**

After clicking the Nami Wallet, you could see two options
New Wallet
Import
This how-to guide is for creating a new wallet. Alternatively, if you would like to import your Yoroi/Daedalus wallet, follow this how-to guide.
To create a new wallet, click on New Wallet. Accept the Terms of Use and click the "Continue" button to forward to the next step.

**4. Store your Seed Phrase**

After clicking continue, Nami will provide you with your unique Seed phrase. This Seed phrase will give you direct access to your Nami Wallet.

⚠️ Note it down in private. You can only recover your account via your Seed Phrase. There is no alternative to this. If you lose your Seed phrase, you cannot recover your wallet.

**5. Create your Account**

After noting down and verifying your Seed Phrase, you will be prompted to create an account. To do so, fill in the desired wallet name and password.

After that, you can click Create.

And you're all set! You can now close this tab by clicking close.

**6. How to find your Nami Wallet Address:**
To find your Nami Wallet Address, open the Nami extension on your browser and click the Receive button, which will open a QR code, and your address will appear below. This is the receiving Cardano Native address of your Nami wallet.
