### **Lesson 101.3: Minting a DFA Learner Token**

What is a DFA Learner Token?

The Deep Funding Academy supports individuals and organizations in learning about the SingularityNet ecosystem, Deep Funding, and how to contribute. Anyone who holds a "Learner Token" can commit to assignments.

When you complete an assignment, and a course facilitator approves it, the completion is stored on-chain and displayed on your DFA learner token.

New possibilities emerge when your DFA Learner Token contains evidence of what you have learned. For example, you can commit to more challenging assignments.

After completing the necessary prerequisites, you can use your DFA Learner Token to mint a Contributor Token, which allows you to commit to projects and earn rewards within an organization.

In this course, we will show you how everything works. To get started, let's mint your DFA Learner Token.

Your DFA Learner Token will be your record of progress in this course. You can give it any name you'd like. It will be as public as any other NFT, so think carefully about how much privacy you want on-chain. For now, an alias is best.

**Step 1: Connect a browser wallet to the Cardano Preproduction Testnet**

This Deep Funding Academy course is built on Cardano's Preproduction Testnet, often called "preProd". We are providing this course on preProd so you can learn how to use the Deep Funding Academy without spending real Ada.

Here is how to connect.

**Step 2: Get some Test Ada.**

To participate in the DeepFunding Academy, you need some test Ada. Navigate to the [Cardano Testnets faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/) to get some free "tAda".

Here's a [quick guide](https://youtu.be/CnXzI4B_pmU) on how to get tAda for the preProd Network from the Cardano Testnets faucet.

**Step 3: Mint your Learner Token!**

Click [here](https://dfa-pbl.vercel.app/course-management/roles/learner/dashboard) to see your `Learner Dashboard`. After you connect your Nami wallet, click the button that says "Mint Your Learner Token." Give it a try!

You will know you are successful if you can see your DFA Learner Token in your Nami Wallet (remember: your Nami should be configured to use the preProd Network, as shown in Lesson 101.2. If this is not the case, you won't be able to see your DFA Learner Token).

Click on `Learner Dashboard` on the Navbar or click [here](https://dfa-pbl.vercel.app/course-management/roles/learner/dashboard). If everything went well, you should see a message like this:
