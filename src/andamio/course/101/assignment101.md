# Mint your DFA Learner Token

## Lesson Objective

In this lesson, you'll journey into blockchain and decentralized finance by minting your DFA Learner Token. This token represents your engagement and achievements within the Deep Funding Academy, utilizing the innovative SingularityNet ecosystem and the Cardano blockchain.

## Lesson Benefits

By completing this lesson, you will mint your DFA Learner Token and gain hands-on experience with NFTs, understand the basics of blockchain technology, and explore the utility and significance of digital tokens in educational and decentralized finance contexts.

## What is a DFA Learner Token?

The Deep Funding Academy supports individuals and organizations in learning about the SingularityNet ecosystem, Deep Funding, and how to contribute. Anyone who holds a "Learner Token" can commit to assignments.

When you complete an assignment, and a course facilitator approves it, the completion is stored on-chain and displayed on your DFA learner token.

When your DFA Learner Token shows what you have learned, new possibilities emerge. For example, you can commit to more challenging assignments.

In this course, we will show you how everything works. To get started, let's mint your DFA Learner Token.

## Before You Start

Take some time to research the specifics of the Cardano blockchain and its Preprod testnet. Learn why testnets are crucial for blockchain development and experimentation.

## How to Mint your DFA Learner Token

Your DFA Learner Token will be your record of progress in this course. You can give it any name you'd like. It will be as public as any other NFT, so think carefully about how much privacy you want on-chain. For now, an alias is best.

### Setting Up your Nami Wallet

Follow the instructions from Lesson 101.2 to set up your Nami wallet and connect it to the Cardano Preprod testnet. Document the process and any challenges you encounter.

### Acquiring Test Ada

Navigate to the **[Cardano Testnets faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/)** to acquire test Ada. Reflect on the importance of test currencies in blockchain education and development.

Here's a **[quick guide](https://youtu.be/CnXzI4B_pmU)** on how to get tAda for the preProd Network from the Cardano Testnets faucet.

### Minting the Learner Token

With your wallet set up and funded with test Ada, mint your DFA Learner Token. This practical step involves interacting with a smart contract on the blockchain.

Click **[here](https://dfa-pbl.vercel.app/course-management/roles/learner/dashboard)** to see your `Learner Dashboard`. After you connect your Nami wallet, click the button that says "Mint Your Learner Token." Give it a try!

You will know you are successful if you can see your DFA Learner Token in your Nami Wallet (remember: your Nami should be configured to use the preProd Network, as shown in Lesson 101.2. If this is not the case, you won't be able to see your DFA Learner Token).

Click on `Learner Dashboard` on the Navbar or click **[here](https://dfa-pbl.vercel.app/course-management/roles/learner/dashboard)**. If everything went well, you should see a message like this:
