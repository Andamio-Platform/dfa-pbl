# **Welcome to Deep Funding Academy - Phase 1: Genesis!**

Greetings, participants! We are excited to welcome you to Deep Funding Academy, where exploration meets expertise in the fascinating world of AI.

Deep Funding Academy operates on a Project-Based Learning (PBL) model, encouraging active learning through hands-on projects. Just like [Plutus PBL 2023](https://plutuspbl.io/), our modules start with clear objectives known as Student Learning Targets (SLTs).

In the spirit of mastery, a status bar at the top of each page is aligned with the SLTs. This visual indicator reflects your progress and accomplishments, offering insights into your journey through the course. Lesson 1 will provide detailed insights into mastering these SLTs effectively.

As you embark on this learning adventure, utilize the sidebar for effortless navigation to different lessons. Each lesson is crafted to unveil diverse aspects of the course material, ensuring a well-rounded understanding.
