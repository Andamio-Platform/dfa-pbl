# Welcome to Deep Funding Academy (DFA) - Phase 1: Genesis!

Greetings, participants! We are excited to welcome you to the Deep Funding Academy, where exploration meets expertise in the fascinating world of AI.

The Deep Funding Academy operates on a Project-Based Learning (PBL) model, encouraging active learning through hands-on projects. Just like **[Plutus PBL 2023](https://plutuspbl.io/)**, our modules start with clear objectives known as Student Learning Targets (SLTs).

A status bar at the top of each page is aligned with the SLTs in the spirit of mastery. This visual indicator reflects your progress and accomplishments, offering insights into your journey through the course.

As you embark on this learning adventure, utilize the sidebar for effortless navigation to different lessons. Each lesson is crafted to unveil diverse aspects of the course material, ensuring a well-rounded understanding.
