Building Community is not just a slogan for social media; building Community is our way of doing things.

In order to complete this module, simply provide a link with evidence that you've completed the tasks outlined in **Lessons 102.1 and 102.2**.

This can be as simple as a link to a google doc with screenshots of your post on Discord and Twitter.
