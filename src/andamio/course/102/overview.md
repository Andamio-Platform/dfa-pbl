### **Module 102: Understanding Deep Funding and SingularityNET**

Perhaps SingularityNET's most impactful initiative is the Deep Funding program. Because SingularityNET is about community, about doing things together, and the Deep Funding project is precisely about that. Doing things together in SingularityNET is not just a catchy slogan for social media; it's a real commitment, a way of getting things done.

_What is Deep Funding?_

Deep Funding is the SingularityNET Community fund for creators and innovators looking to carry out and bring their projects to life. With the goal of supporting and funding AI projects and products that will later become part of their decentralized marketplace, SingularityNET allocates 30% of the minted AGIX tokens on the Cardano and Ethereum networks, distributed in funding rounds throughout the year.

The community selects eligible proposals, and through a vibrant voting process where community members have the opportunity to comment, correct, and edit proposals, decisions are made on which projects will receive funding. The Deep Funding have developed a quadratic voting intertwined with a reputation system based on wallet's history record, allowing every project and specially new members to also have funding opportunities. In the last funding round, Round 3, there were 117 eligible projects, over 220 wallets voting, and more than 1.5 million AGIX tokens were distributed among 43 funded projects.

_Overview of the SingularityNET Ecosystem_

SingularityNET is a groundbreaking decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) marketplace. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, SingularityNET provides unrestricted access to a vast array of algorithms and applications. But, SingularityNET is much more than a decentralized marketplace, is an entire universe and with all its complexity, embraces a variety of different projects and spin-offs on Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Robotics, Biotechnology and Longevity, Media, Games, Art and Entertainment, and Enterprise AI.

Spearheaded by Dr. Ben Goertzel, SingularityNET's primary goal is to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) with far-reaching capabilities that result beneficial to humanity and all life on Earth. Developing open-source code is not enough to avoid AI centralization; decentralization must happen at every level. In SingularityNET we believe decentralizing AI governance might be the key to building Beneficial General Intelligence (BGI). This means allowing a diverse group of humans to decide and make Community-driven decisions to ethically and fairly manage the technologies that are soon to emerge. A technology as powerful as AGI cannot be in the hands of one or two super-powerful groups; it needs to be in the hands of as many humans as possible.

That’s why SingularityNET Community is a complex and vibrant ecosystem of creators, innovators, and scientists. We are strong believers in the power of human bonds and collaborative friendships. _For us building Community is not just a slogan for social media, it’s a way of doing things_.
