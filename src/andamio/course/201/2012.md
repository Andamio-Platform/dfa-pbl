### **Lesson 201.2: I can write a consistent and eligible proposal**

Now that you know what it takes to participate in Deep Funding you can start working on **Creating a Comprehensive Proposal.**

To help you in the proccess here is a set of **tips and steps for you to create your proposal**

1. Start by **selecting an idea** and **identifying in what pool** this idea fits. Check pool info here: https://deepfunding.ai/rules/#Round4BetaTestround8211PoolDetails
2. Check the **requirements for proposals on the pool you select** to understand the requirements you need to follow.
3. Go through **similar proposals** previously approved in the category you desire. **Use them as inspiration to complete your proposal.** You can find all the proposals here: https://deepfunding.ai/projects-and-proposals/
4. Start **creating your proposal on the Deep Funding Platform**, or if that is not available, create a document and search to answer the same questions answered by proposals from the previous round.
5. **Create** a compelling **Deep Funding Profile**. Add relevant information about yourself and your work experience in your profile, especially considering the proposal you're creating, and make sure your team members do the same. Understanding the experience of the team, is really important for voters to understand the likelihood of success of your proposal.
6. You can also watch this video, that goes through the **process of exploring the Deep Funding platform** and showing you how to check previous proposals and how to create your own: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-6_jhYpWgI

If you need additional information on how to **create and refine your idea**, check out this workshop Swarm recorded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPifzITmqsk

**Extra tips** :

- Be mindful of the reader. Try to put yourself in their shoes, **keep it simple, avoid getting too technical, and don't write more than you actually need to.**

- Try to **make your proposal** look **visually appealing** and stand out form all the rest.

- Look for a way for people to understand and **relate to the problem and the solution. Tell stories, and give examples.**

- Make sure you share enough for people to **understand the impact and potential** for your idea, and feel confident that your team is able to deliver it.

Task-> **Write a Proposal for one of your ideas** from the previous step, following the Deep Funding Guidelines and what you learned in this course.
