# Lesson 201.3: I can design a coherent Milestone Budget

The **Milestones and Budget** are super important, they will **define how funding is disbursed** and have a significant **impact on how you will deliver your proposal.**

It's important to note that on Deep Funding, **you're paid for milestone completed**. And your payment only reaches your wallet, after you've completed the entire milestone.

This is very important to consider because you need to create your milestones in a way where you have the necessary funds to deliver it, especially if you need to pay for services or external help.

## Here are some tips to prepare your milestones and budget:

1. First start by checking out the rules in the Deep Funding Website. The **[rules for milestones](https://deepfunding.ai/rules/#Round4BetaTestround8211PoolDetails) will be specific for the funding pool you chose for your proposal**. Please follow them or your proposal might be disqualified.
2. Plan and Break your project into the **main actions and goals you will need** to complete, in order to deliver your idea. From this you will be able to **define your milestones**. Make sure you have an **achievable and realistic plan** to deliver on your project.
3. **Estimate the resources** you will need an how much it will **cost** to deliver each milestone.
4. Be **transparent with your budget** and how you reached these values, and **back it up with data** and reasoning for your cost estimates. This kind of transparency builds confidence of voters.

While creating milestones you can **add as many as you need** to deliver your project succesfully and this are the questions you need to answer when creating each of your milestones:

- **Milestone Name**
- **Budget** - Total budget for milestone
- **Milestone Description** - here you can explain what the milestone consists, the actions that will be carried, you can even state the role of each team member, and explain the costs in the name of transparency and accountability.
- **Milestone deliverables** - Here you should share the actual outcomes and deliverables of the milestone. Like for example an app, a document, a marketing campaign with specific goals. To maximimize your chances of being funded your milestones should be enticing and ambitious but at the same time achievable.

If you feel there is more that you would like to share about your milestones, but there is not enough space, you can explain it in the long-description part of your proposal.

### Task

Create a Budget for all of your milestones, that follows Deep Funding Guidelines and what you've learned in this course. Pay attention to things like character limits to make it more realistic.
