### **Lesson 202.1: I can write a high-quality review of a proposal**

**What is Proposal Review in Deep-Funding?**
In deep funding, proposal review is giving constructive and related
opinions about a submitted proposal. It is a way of providing value to proposers by sourcing community opinion, it is a very subjective process, as such there are no hard rules, the review can be on any of the following; the state of the proposal, the intent of the proposal, application, use case, appreciation, missing piece, suggestion etc., the list is endless, it can be either a positive opinion or a negative opinion, what is most critical is that you give your opinion and that your opinion has 2 basic characteristics which is:
(i) It is related to the proposal being submitted
(2) It is original

**What Makes a Good Review?**
Like already stated a good proposal review should be related to the
proposal being submitted, so it is not expected that your opinion will have nothing to do with what was submitted, take for example, you are not expected to be talking about cars when the proposal is about health, that will be flagged down or downvoted, anyone who sees your proposal should be able to link its relevance to the submitted proposal. The other side is that it should be original, by that it means that the proposal should not be copied and pasted from other related proposals, so it should not be that you are copying other people\'s comments or repeating another comment you have already made. Also, it is not a good practice to use Chatgpt to copy and paste, while the use of Chatgpt is not totally condemned in Deepfunding, it is expected that the Chatgpt or
conversational AI used is added with a touch of your opinion, but if you are seeking what the optimal solution is, then don\'t even use Chatgpt, your original idea is what is needed. Another thing is don\'t make it one line, a one-line shows you did not take time to go through the proposal, and also don\'t make it too long such that it becomes boring to read through, keep it at a reasonable amount.

**How to write your first review**
The process of writing a review in deep funding is very simple,
(i) Step 1: Read the proposal thoroughly
(ii) Step 2: Craft a summary of the proposal in your mind
(iii) Step 3: State your opinion on the proposal
(iv) Step 4: Ask yourself how related and relevant your opinion is to the proposal
(v) Step 5: Put down your opinion in the comment section of the proposal and submit.
