# Lesson 202.1: I can write a high-quality review of a proposal

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you'll dive into proposal review within the Deep Funding ecosystem. You will read, analyze, and constructively review a submitted proposal, applying relevance, originality, and constructive feedback criteria. This lesson aims to enhance your evaluative skills, allowing you to contribute valuable insights to proposers and the community.

## Lesson Objectives

- Develop the ability to critically analyze proposals within the context of Deep Funding's objectives.
- Learn to provide constructive, relevant, and original feedback that adds value to the proposal review process.
- Enhance communication skills by articulating well-thought-out reviews that support proposers in refining their submissions.

## What is Proposal Review in Deep Funding?

In Deep Funding, a proposal review gives constructive and related opinions about a submitted proposal. It is a way of providing value to proposers by sourcing community opinion; it is a very subjective process; as such, there are no hard rules; the review can be on any of the following: the state of the proposal, the intent of the proposal, application, use case, appreciation, a missing piece, suggestion, etc., the list is endless, it can be either a positive opinion or a negative opinion, what is most critical is that you give your opinion and that your opinion has two essential characteristics which is:

1. It is related to the proposal being submitted
2. It is original

## What Makes a Good Review?

As already stated, a good proposal review should be related to the proposal submitted, so it is not expected that your opinion will have nothing to do with what was submitted; for example, you are not likely to be talking about cars when the proposal is about health, that will be flagged down or downvoted, anyone who sees your proposal should be able to link its relevance to the submitted proposal. The other side is that it should be original; by that, it means that the proposal should not be copied and pasted from other related proposals, so it should not be that you are copying other people \'s comments or repeating another comment you have already made. Also, it is not a good practice to use Chatgpt to copy and paste; while the use of Chatgpt is not condemned in Deep Funding, it is expected that the Chatgpt or conversational AI used is added with a touch of your opinion, but if you are seeking what the optimal solution is, then don\'t even use Chatgpt, your original idea is what is needed. Another thing is don't make it one line; a one-line shows you did not take time to go through the proposal, and only make it a short time such that it becomes tedious to read through, keep it at a reasonable amount.

## Proposal Selection

Start by selecting a proposal from the Deep Funding platform. Choose one that aligns with your interests or expertise to ensure your review is informed and constructive.

## Thorough Analysis

Read the proposal thoroughly. Take notes on its objectives, methods, potential impact, and any areas that might be unclear or could be improved. Summarize the proposal in your own words to solidify your understanding.

## Crafting Your Review

Based on your analysis, state your opinion on the proposal. Focus on providing constructive feedback that addresses both strengths and areas for improvement. Ensure your feedback is specific, relevant to the proposal, and original.

## Relevance and Originality Check

Reflect on your review to ensure it directly relates to the proposal and offers unique insights. Adjust your review to avoid generalities and ensure it contributes value to the proposer and the Deep Funding community.

## Review Submission

Write your review in the comment section of the proposal on the Deep Funding platform. Follow the platform's guidelines for submission.
