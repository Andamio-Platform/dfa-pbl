## Deep Funding Academy Guidelines for Reviewing Proposals

1. **Understand the Mission**
   Familiarize yourself with the goals and objectives of Deep Funding. Ensure your reviews align with these goals, providing constructive feedback that supports the mission.

2. **Read Thoroughly**
   Before reviewing, read the proposal carefully. Understand its objectives, methodology, expected outcomes, and how it fits within the Deep Funding ecosystem.

3. **Be Constructive**
   Offer constructive feedback that can help proposers improve their submissions. Highlight strengths as well as areas for improvement.

4. **Stay Relevant**

8. **Respect Privacy**
   Do not share personal information about proposers or discuss proposal details outside the review platform without permission.
