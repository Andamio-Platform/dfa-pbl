## **Lesson 202.3: I know the quality standards and Deep Funding mission for proposal eligibility approval**

Deepfunding has a set of standards and criteria for knowing if a
proposal is eligible for a round or not, part of your job as a reviewer is to be able to determine that, this process helps to weed irrelevant proposals out of the system and to remove proposals from the wrong pools into their right pools. To determine if the a project is even eligible to be in that pool will save both the proposer and the reviewer the challenge of wasted efforts and having to get their proposals or efforts
wasted. So to check the eligibility of a project, here are the
indicators

**(i) Pool Theme:** Is the proposal carrying the theme of the pool it was submitted under, to know this, it is important to read thoroughly the themes of the pool, this is always in the description of the pool, through that you can easily determine if the proposal submitted fits into that pool, take for example a marketing pool, where the description is to find proposals that will market Deepfunding or SingularityNet but theres a proposal in same pool talking about how to build an AI solution, such a proposal is in a wrong pool as such not eligible, a reviewer should be able to flag such.

**(II) Funding Request Amount**: Some pools have a maximum amount that is allowed by each proposer, while some pools may also have a minimum amount that is allowed, this information are quite very important, and in the case that a proposer asks an amount that is more than or lower than what is allowed in that pool it is your duty as a reviewer to flag that proposal as it does not fit into the eligibility of that pool. To know this as a reviewer it is important that you have read the description of the pool as well.

**(iii) Budgeting Structure**: It is possible that a pool may have a very strict budgeting structure, the structure determines how funds are being allocated and to what, for example in the past funds, the New project pool had a mandatory 25% of the requested fund going into API calls and 10% towards onboarding, any proposal submitted in which the proposers did not follow this budget structure is not eligible for that pool, so as a reviewer you are mandated to flag any such proposal.

**TASK:** Check for 1 eligible project and 1 ineligible project from past submission and state why it was eligible and inelligible
