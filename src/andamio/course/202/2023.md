# Lesson 202.3: I know the quality standards and Deep Funding mission for proposal eligibility approval

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will act as a reviewer within the Deep Funding ecosystem, tasked with evaluating the eligibility of proposals based on Deep Funding's standards and mission. You will analyze proposals to determine their alignment with the specified pool themes, funding request amounts, and budgeting structures.

## Lesson Objectives

- Understand Deep Funding's mission and how it influences proposal evaluation criteria.
- Learn to assess proposals against Deep Funding's quality standards for theme alignment, funding request appropriateness, and budgeting structure compliance.
- Develop the ability to discern between eligible and ineligible proposals, contributing to the efficiency and effectiveness of the Deep Funding review process.

## Familiarization with Deep Funding Criteria

Deep Funding has a set of standards and criteria to know if a proposal is eligible for a round or not; part of your job as a reviewer is to be able to determine that; this process helps to weed irrelevant proposals out of the system and to remove proposals from the wrong pools into their suitable pools. Determining if the project is even eligible to be in that pool will save both the proposer and the reviewer time and effort. So, to check the eligibility of a project, here are the pertinent indicators:

1. **Pool Theme**: It's essential to ensure that the proposal aligns with the theme of the pool under which it was submitted. It's crucial to thoroughly review the pool's themes to determine if the proposal fits within that pool. For example, suppose a proposal is submitted to a marketing pool. In that case, it should be focused on marketing Deep Funding or SingularityNet. If a proposal discussing building an AI solution is submitted to the same pool, it would be considered ineligible. Reviewers should be able to identify and flag such proposals.

2. **Funding Request Amount**: Some pools have a maximum amount allowed by each proposer and a minimum amount permitted. This information is quite important, and if a proposer asks for an amount that is more than or lower than what is allowed in that pool, it is your duty as a reviewer to flag that proposal as it does not fit into the pool's eligibility. You must also read the pool description to know this as a reviewer.

3. **Budgeting Structure**: A pool may have a rigorous budgeting structure; the structure determines how funds are being allocated and to what, for example in the past funds, the New project pool had a mandatory 25% of the requested fund going into API calls and 10% towards onboarding, any proposal submitted in which the proposers did not follow this budget structure is not eligible for that pool, so as a reviewer you are mandated to flag any such proposal.

### Task

**Proposal Selection**
Check for one eligible project and one ineligible project from past submissions.

**Eligibility Analysis**
Analyze each selected proposal to determine why one was eligible, and the other was not. For the eligible proposal, identify how it aligns with the pool theme, adheres to the funding request guidelines, and follows the prescribed budgeting structure. For the ineligible proposal, pinpoint the criteria it fails to meet.

**Review and Feedback**
Create a feedback report for each proposal. Provide constructive suggestions for revising an ineligible proposal to meet the eligibility criteria. For an eligible proposal, recommend ways to better align with Deep Funding's mission and increase its impact.
