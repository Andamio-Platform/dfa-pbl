## **Lesson 202.3: I know the quality standards and Deep Funding mission for proposal eligibility approval**

Deep Funding has a set of standards and criteria to know if a proposal is eligible for a round or not; part of your job as a reviewer is to be able to determine that; this process helps to weed irrelevant proposals out of the system and to remove proposals from the wrong pools into their suitable pools. Determining if the project is even eligible to be in that pool will save both the proposer and the reviewer time and effort. So, to check the eligibility of a project, here are the pertinent indicators:

**(i) Pool Theme:** It's important to ensure that the proposal aligns with the theme of the pool under which it was submitted. It's crucial to thoroughly review the pool's themes to determine if the proposal fits within that pool. For example, if a proposal is submitted to a marketing pool, it should be focused on marketing Deep Funding or SingularityNet. If a proposal discussing building an AI solution is submitted to the same pool, it would be considered ineligible. Reviewers should be able to identify and flag such proposals.

**(ii) Funding Request Amount**: Some pools have a maximum amount allowed by each proposer, while some pools may also have a minimum amount permitted. This information is quite important, and if a proposer asks for an amount that is more than or lower than what is allowed in that pool, it is your duty as a reviewer to flag that proposal as it does not fit into the pool's eligibility. To know this as a reviewer, you must also read the pool description.

**(iii) Budgeting Structure**: A pool may have a rigorous budgeting structure; the structure determines how funds are being allocated and to what, for example in the past funds, the New project pool had a mandatory 25% of the requested fund going into API calls and 10% towards onboarding, any proposal submitted in which the proposers did not follow this budget structure is not eligible for that pool, so as a reviewer you are mandated to flag any such proposal.
