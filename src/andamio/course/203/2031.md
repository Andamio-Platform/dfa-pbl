### **Lesson 203.1: Participating in Deep Funding Rounds**

Here’s how you can participate:

**Lesson 1: I have familiarised myself with the Voting Process:**
Each DeepFunding Round will announce and release relevant voting guidelines, as well as updates and announcements on its news blog as well on social media channels.
Follow announcements on the DeepFunding Portal to easily stay up to date. [https://deepfunding.ai/updates/](https://deepfunding.ai/updates/)

Once you are familiar on the voting processes, we can move ahead and learn about getting yourself and your wallets prepared.

**Lesson 2: I can use the Wallet Linking Tool:**
SingularityNET offers us to use a Wallet Linking Tool which makes it easier for processes such as voting to take the total amount of AGIX you are holding into account, without the need to go through the same process again with multiple wallets.
You can connect and link you wallets at this link:
[https://mywallets.singularitynet.io/](https://mywallets.singularitynet.io/)

Additional information and FAQ can be found at the same link, make sure to take some time reading through everything `:)`.

If you and your wallets are all set, you are ready to cast your vote.

**Lesson 3: I can navigate the Voting Platform:**
SingularityNET’s voting platform, used to cast community votes, provides additional information and guidelines which are updated and adjusted for each voting event. Make sure to take some time and to read carefully through guiding information on the voting portal.
[https://voting.deepfunding.ai/](https://voting.deepfunding.ai/)

And there you go, once you are on the platform, connect your wallet and cast your votes.

1. Select the category
   Proposals are categorised into several “pools”. If you select a Pool, you can find all listed proposals on which you can vote

2. Cast your votes on the proposals
   You will see that you can vote on a scale of 0 to 10 for each proposal whereby 0 is the lowest vote and 10 the highest vote which can be given. You can vote on as many proposals as you want, yet keep in mind that you can vote only once for each proposal.
   Once you casted all your votes, you can sign and confirm your vote via clicking the button on the bottom of the page. The browser extortion of your wallet will open up, you enter your password and that's it. Your vote is officially casted and no tokens are spent.

#### Action:

**Cast your vote in a DeepFunding round.**
