### **Lesson 203.1: Participating in Deep Funding Rounds**

Here's how you can participate:

**Lesson 1: I have familiarised myself with the Voting Process:**
Each DeepFunding Round will announce relevant voting guidelines and post updates and announcements on its news blog and social media channels.
Follow announcements on the Deep Funding Portal to stay up to date quickly. [https://deepfunding.ai/updates/](https://deepfunding.ai/updates/)

Once you are familiar with the voting processes, we can move ahead and learn about preparing yourself and your wallets.

**Lesson 2: I can use the Wallet Linking Tool:**
SingularityNET offers us a Wallet Linking Tool, which makes it easier for processes such as voting to take the total amount of AGIX you are holding into account without the need to go through the same process again with multiple wallets.
You can connect and link your wallets at this link:
[https://mywallets.singularitynet.io/](https://mywallets.singularitynet.io/)

Additional information and a FAQ are available at the same link; take some time to read through everything. :).

You are ready to cast your vote if you and your wallets are all set.

**Lesson 3: I can navigate the Voting Platform:**
SingularityNET's voting platform, used to cast community votes, provides additional information and guidelines, which are updated and adjusted for each voting event. Take some time and read carefully through the guiding information on the voting portal.
[https://voting.deepfunding.ai/](https://voting.deepfunding.ai/)

And there you go; once on the platform, connect your wallet and cast your votes.

1. Select the category
   Proposals are categorized into several "pools". If you select a Pool, you can find all the listed proposals on which you can vote.

2. Cast your votes on the proposals
   You will see that you can vote on a scale of 0 to 10 for each proposal, whereby 0 is the lowest vote, and 10 is the highest vote. You can vote on as many proposals as you want, yet remember that you can vote only once for each proposal.
   Once you cast all your votes, you can sign and confirm your vote by clicking the button at the bottom of the page. The browser extension of your wallet will open up; you enter your password, and that's it. Your vote is officially cast, and no tokens are spent.
