### **Lesson 203.2: Understand Your Voting Power**

Your influence in Deep Funding is determined by your voting power, a combination of AGIX holdings and certain engagement levels within the community. To calculate one's voting power, we can take two categories into account.

**1. The AGIX Assets & Behaviour**
**2. Specific Contributions**

Let's look a bit deeper on these categories

Lesson XXX: AGIX Assets & Behaviour
DeepFunding, at this point of time, follows a basic plutocratic approach, in which voting power is defined by the amount of AGIX held by a voter. In a drastically simplified way you can think of it as
1000 AGIX = 1000 Voting Power, and
1 AGIX = 1 Voting Power.
So, the more AGIX you hold, the more power you have. Yet, it's a bit more complicated than that.

DeepFunding develops and improves parameters to provide a more equal voting power distribution across large and small holders which is captured under a Contribution score which is applied to voting wallets. Some important factors of the Contribution score are:

A. Wallet Age
By Wallet Age, we mean the time since a wallet holds AGIX token. If you hold tokens for several years, your assets will have a stronger impact as if they were bought just before the voting event for example. This aims to favorise long term relations which the ecosystem aims to establish with its community.

B. Community Engagements
To incentivise and support community engagements, DeepFunding develops, in active collaboration with the community, an Contribution score which provides an algorithm to transform community engagement into voting weight. As more valuable engagements from a community member, as higher their contribution score and as such, an increase in their gained voting weight. While the specific parameters are constantly identified and developed here are some parameters used in previous DeepFunding Rounds.
